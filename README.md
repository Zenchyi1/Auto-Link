# Auto link
A plugin for automatically linking to already existing files.
![Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107559945/194766142-1d260897-db98-4cba-bd62-d28cb01602da.gif)

This plugin is still very much in beta.

## Installation
Just copy the files into the .obsidian/plugins directory in your vault.

## How it works 
It checks every time a file got modified (aka saved) and then looks for linkable words in the last few lines from the cursor. 

### TODO
- Search every file for links when a new file is added
- add sanity checks
- find a more efficient way to find links
