## Warning
I discourage using this plugin on large vaults for now, as it's fairly inefficient. Further versions should improve on this. 

## 
Ive stop using Obsidian, and due to that don't see a reason to continue working on this repo. I'll archieve it, but am happy to transfer ownership in case someone wants to continue working on this.
